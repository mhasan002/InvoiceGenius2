Page: Total Insights
🧩 Purpose:
The Total Insights page gives users a quick overview of their invoice activity — including the total number of invoices created, the total invoice worth (cash flow), and optionally a visual trend graph. Users can also filter the data by a specific date range to view custom insights.

🖥️ UI Layout Design:
📌 1. Page Header
Title: "Total Insights"

Positioned at the top-left of the content area

Optionally display: “Last updated: [timestamp]”

📌 2. Date Range Filter
Positioned top-right or top-center of the content area

Filter label: "Filter by Date Range:"

Two input fields or a date range picker:

Start Date

End Date

Optional quick buttons:

“Today”

“This Week”

“This Month”

Apply Filter button next to inputs

On submit:

Updates all data below (summary cards, chart, recent list)

🔒 Make sure default view shows data from the last 30 days if no filter is selected

📌 3. Summary Cards
Displayed in a flex or grid layout (2 or 3 per row)

Each card is styled with:

Soft shadow, rounded corners, icon on top left

🟦 Card 1: Total Invoices
Title: "Total Invoices"

Value: e.g., “27”

Icon: 📄

🟩 Card 2: Total Worth
Title: "Total Invoice Worth"

Value: e.g., “$12,300”

Icon: 💰

(Optional) 🟨 Card 3: Average Invoice Value
Title: "Avg. Invoice Value"

Value: e.g., “$455”

Icon: 📊

📌 4. Chart Section (Trend Overview)
Positioned below summary cards

Use a bar chart or line graph

X-axis: Time (days/weeks/months based on selected date range)

Y-axis: Total amount of invoices

Tooltip on hover showing:

Date

Amount

If no data in range: show "No data available for selected dates"

Use Chart.js, Recharts, or similar

📌 5. Recent Invoices Snapshot (Optional)
Below the chart or side-by-side on wide screens

A table or compact list showing recent invoice entries from the selected date range

Columns:

Invoice ID

Client Name

Date

Amount

Sorted by latest date

Not editable — just for quick viewing

📱 Responsive Design:
All sections stack vertically on small screens

Summary cards become single-column

Chart and filters occupy full width

Date picker and buttons become dropdown or modal on mobile

🎨 Styling Notes:
Summary cards: white background, primary color accents

Graph: subtle grid lines, soft color lines/bars

Font: Inter, Poppins, or modern sans-serif

Hover effects for buttons, filters, and cards
