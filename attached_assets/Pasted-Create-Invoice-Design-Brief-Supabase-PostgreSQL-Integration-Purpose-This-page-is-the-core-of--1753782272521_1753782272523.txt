Create Invoice
Design Brief + Supabase PostgreSQL Integration

🧾 Purpose:
This page is the core of the entire invoice system. It must allow users to create invoices by selecting and combining data from all other pages—Company Profiles, Services, Packages, Templates, and Payment Methods—and generate a live preview and downloadable PDF using their selected template.

All data must be stored and retrieved from PostgreSQL via Supabase.

🖼️ Page Layout:
🔹 Header:
Page Title: Create Invoice

Buttons:

🔹 Section 1: Client Details (Bill To)
Editable input fields:

Client Name

Phone Number

Address

➕ Add Custom Field (e.g. TIN No, Company Reg No.)

These details should show up in the Bill To section of the invoice

All input values should be stored with the invoice in Supabase

🔹 Section 2: Add Services & Packages
Two clickable tabs:

🔧 Services

🎁 Packages

➤ When Services is selected:
Dropdown list of all services (from Services page)

For each added service:

Select service

Input quantity

Optional: Time period

System multiplies:
Total = Unit Price × Quantity × Time Period

➤ When Packages is selected:
Dropdown list of all packages (from Packages page)

For each added package:

Select package

Input quantity

Optional: Time period

System multiplies:
Total = Package Price × Quantity × Time Period

Show the list of services included in the package, but do not calculate their unit prices separately

✅ If both services and packages are selected, the system must not conflict the prices. It must use the unit price for individual services, and the flat package price for packages.

Example:

Service: FB Ads → $500 (Qty 2)

Package: FB Ads + Graphics (Qty 1) → $300

Display:

yaml
Copy
Edit
Item Description:
FB Ads – Qty: 2
FB Ads (from package) – Qty: 1
Graphics (from package) – Qty: 2
Total: $1300
🔹 Section 3: Price Modifiers
Input:

📦 Tax %

💸 Discount (Flat or %)

🖋️ Platform (Optional writeable field, like "Upwork", shown at top of invoice)

🔹 Section 4: Payable To (Receiver Info)
Must-fill input: "Payment Received By" (Text input)

System auto-fills rest of this section using the selected Company Profile:

Company Name, Address, Email

Logo (resized)

Custom fields (ex: Tax ID)

This will be shown as “Payable To” in the invoice.

🔹 Section 5: Payment Method
Dropdown of all saved payment methods (Bank, Card, Crypto, or custom)

Selected value will be shown in the invoice footer or designated template field

🔹 Section 6: Template Application + Live Preview
Fetches the default selected template from Templates page

Field toggles (hide/show price, notes, terms, etc.)

Field name changes

Colors, styling, header/footer

Any removed fields (like “Price”) should not appear in preview/PDF

Also includes:

Add Note

Add Terms & Conditions

Toggle ON/OFF buttons for each of them

Live preview of invoice should match PDF exactly

🔹 Section 7: Final Actions
