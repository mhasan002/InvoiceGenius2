Company Profile
🧩 Purpose:
This page allows users to create and manage multiple company profiles. Each profile includes essential company details such as name, email, address, and logo. Users can upload a company logo of any size, which the system automatically resizes to a fixed dimension for consistency. Additionally, users can create and add any number of custom fields to tailor company information to their specific needs (e.g., phone number, website, tax ID).

💾 Database Connectivity & Data Persistence
When creating, updating, or deleting a company profile, send all profile data (including custom fields and logo metadata) to the database.

Fetch the list of company profiles from the database on page load to display existing profiles.

Uploaded logos should be stored either in the database as a URL or in a file storage system connected to the database.

Ensure all data updates maintain consistency, and deleted profiles are removed from the database.

🧠 Behavior & Validation
Uploaded logo images of any size are resized automatically to maintain consistent display sizes across the app.

Custom fields are fully editable and flexible — users define field names and input values.

Company name and email fields are required; address and custom fields are optional.

When editing, previously added custom fields are displayed and editable.
