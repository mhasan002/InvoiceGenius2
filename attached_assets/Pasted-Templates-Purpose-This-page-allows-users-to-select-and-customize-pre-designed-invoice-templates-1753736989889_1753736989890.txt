Templates
🧾 Purpose:

This page allows users to select and customize pre-designed invoice templates. All users will see the same set of starter templates, and once selected, they can personalize them fully — including layout fields, labels, colors, and visibility toggles — to fit their branding and workflow.

Users can toggle off/on fields, rename fields, add custom fields, and configure options like notes, terms & conditions, etc. A live preview shows what the final PDF invoice will look like.
